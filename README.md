# hosvd-denoising-project

Simple MATLAB code for calculating the higher order singlular value decomposition of a noisy video file, discarding singular values and reconstructing the video. Denoising and error correction are measured by PSNR. 

TODO:

- hard thresholding
- wiener filter
- cube clustering/stacking
